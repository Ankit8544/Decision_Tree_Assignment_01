    "**`Consider` a medical diagnosis system that classifies patients based on whether they have a specific disease, let's say a rare form of cancer. In this scenario, recall is the most crucial metric.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Here's why` :**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recall** tells us the proportion of actual positive cases (patients with the disease) that the model correctly identifies. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **High recall** ensures we catch most, if not all, of the actual cases. Missing a case (false negative) could have severe consequences for the patient's health. Early detection is critical for effective treatment in many diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision**, on the other hand, tells us the proportion of patients the model identifies as having the disease who actually do. While a high precision is desirable, it's less critical in this case. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A false positive (identifying a healthy patient as having the disease) might lead to unnecessary tests or anxiety, but it's a less severe consequence compared to missing a true case.\n",
    "*  Doctors can follow up on false positives with further investigation to confirm the diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore**, in situations where missing a positive case (high false negative rate) carries a much higher cost than a false positive, prioritizing recall becomes essential. "
